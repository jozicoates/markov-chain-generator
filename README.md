# Markov Chain Generator

This is an independent project for my CS 370 Artificial Intelligence course.

The text generator can be used with any .txt file, while the midi generator can have any midi file as an input.

I used Python, MIT's music21 library (https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/index.html), and Musescore 3 (https://musescore.org/en/download) for this project.
